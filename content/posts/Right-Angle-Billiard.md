Ever noticed that when you kick the billiard ball off-center, there‚Äôs only one possible result?


## Solution

### Step 1: Understanding the Situation

- We have **two balls of equal mass**.  
- One ball is moving; the other is stationary.  
- The collision is **elastic**, meaning **no energy is lost**, and the balls bounce perfectly.  
- The moving ball can hit the stationary ball **directly in the center** (head-on) or **off-center** (glancing).



### Step 2: Momentum

- **Momentum** is the motion carried by an object and is conserved in all collisions.  
- We consider two directions:  
  1. **Forward direction** (the original direction of the moving ball).  
  2. **Sideways direction** (perpendicular to the original direction).  

- Before the collision, all the motion is in the forward direction.  
- After the collision, the momentum is shared between the two balls in both directions:  
  - Some momentum goes forward for each ball.  
  - Some momentum goes sideways if the hit is off-center.



### Step 3: Energy

- **Kinetic energy** is also conserved in an elastic collision.  
- This means the total motion energy before and after the collision is the same.  
- The moving ball transfers some of its energy to the stationary ball, depending on how off-center the hit is.  



### Step 4: Types of Collision and Resulting Angles

1. **Head-on collision**:  
   - The moving ball hits the center of the stationary ball.  
   - Both balls move along the **same straight line**.  
   - **Angle between the balls:** 0 degrees.

2. **Off-center collision**:  
   - The moving ball hits the side of the stationary ball.  
   - The balls move away from each other **at a right angle**, forming a perfect ‚ÄúL‚Äù shape.  
   - **Angle between the balls:** 90 degrees.

> For collisions in between these two extremes, the angle will vary between 0 and 90 degrees, depending on exactly how far from the center the hit occurs.



### Step 5: Summary Table

| Collision Type       | Angle Between Balls |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Head-on             | 0¬∞               |
| Perfect Off-Center  | 90¬∞              |



### Key Takeaways

- Elastic collisions conserve both **momentum** and **energy**.  
- Equal-mass balls striking off-center always produce a **right-angle separation**.  
- The exact angle depends on the **impact point**.  
- Using words, you can imagine the ‚Äúmoving ball‚Äù pushing the stationary one sideways, creating a neat perpendicular path.

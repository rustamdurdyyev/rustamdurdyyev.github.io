<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6; color:#34495e;">
As a lifelong football fan, I‚Äôve spent countless hours watching matches ‚Äî from thrilling men's World Cup finals to exciting women's international tournaments. The beautiful game has always been my passion, and I can‚Äôt help but notice patterns that others might miss.
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6; color:#34495e;">
Over the years, one thing has really caught my eye: <strong>women's international matches often seem to have more goals than men's</strong>. As someone who loves both watching and analyzing football, I couldn‚Äôt resist digging into the data to see if my gut feeling is correct. This could make for an exciting story my readers would love!
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6; color:#34495e;">
To make sure my analysis is fair, I decided to focus on <strong>official FIFA World Cup matches</strong> (excluding qualifiers) since <strong>January 1, 2002</strong>. The game has evolved a lot over the years, so I wanted to compare the most recent trends in both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs football.
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6; color:#34495e;">
I gathered two datasets with the results of every official international match:
<ul>
<li><code>women_results.csv</code> ‚Äì all women's matches</li>
<li><code>men_results.csv</code> ‚Äì all men's matches</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6; color:#34495e;">
Here‚Äôs the question I wanted to answer:
</p>

<blockquote style="font-size:16px; color:#16a085; border-left:4px solid #16a085; padding-left:12px;">
Do women's international soccer matches really have <strong>more goals</strong> than men's?
</blockquote>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6; color:#34495e;">
I decided to test this using a <strong>10% significance level</strong>, comparing the mean number of goals scored in each gender‚Äôs matches:
<ul>
<li><strong>H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis):</strong> The mean number of goals scored in women's matches is the same as in men's.</li>
<li><strong>H‚Çê (Alternative Hypothesis):</strong> The mean number of goals scored in women's matches is <strong>greater</strong> than in men's.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 style="color:#16a085;">What does it mean to reject the hypothesis?</h2>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6; color:#34495e;">
In simple terms, rejecting the null hypothesis (<strong>H‚ÇÄ</strong>) means that the data provides **strong evidence** that the alternative hypothesis (<strong>H‚Çê</strong>) is true. In our case, it suggests that the **average number of goals in women's international matches is indeed higher than in men's** at the 10% significance level. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6; color:#34495e;">
This doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúprove‚Äù it with 100% certainty ‚Äî statistics never do ‚Äî but it gives us confidence that the trend we observed as a football fan is backed up by real data.

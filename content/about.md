## About Me

I am a **Data Scientist and Researcher** with a strong foundation in **Physics and Engineering (Dr.-Ing.)**, passionate about solving complex problems in both science and industry. My work combines **computational modeling, first-principles simulations, and machine learning**, bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical applications. I enjoy tackling challenges in **physics, materials science, and data-driven analytics**, turning complex datasets into meaningful insights.  

You can explore my **[Publications & Honors](/publications/)** to see my research contributions, and I warmly invite you to visit my **[blog](/posts/)**, where I share projects, experiments, and reflections on scientific discoveries, data science, and technology, as well as life experiences. Outside of work, I enjoy **hiking, running, and playing football**, which helps me stay active, curious, and creative in both my professional and personal life.  

I love collaborating with others, solving tricky problems, and turning ideas into results. Whether it’s analyzing data, designing experiments, or exploring new technologies, I’m driven by curiosity, learning, and making an impact in both research and real-world applications.
